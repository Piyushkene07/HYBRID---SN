How to run the code :
 
1. Run the python file provided in code folder.
2. A pop up will be shown where you need to provide the required image data file provided in Data folder.
3. Another pop up will be shown where you need to provide the required image ground truth file provided in Data folder.
3. It will ask you for the no. of epoches provide suitable epochs, from our observation even 30 epochs give good result.
4. wait for some time it will show the final True and predicted images side by side.
5. After that it will show the plot of training accuracy vs epochs.
6. At last it will show the whole classification Report for the given dataset.

Results :-

1.Results are provided in output folder.
2.It contains the graph plot, accuracy report and true and predicted image.
3.Indian_pines :-->
	a) epoches = 30.
         Training Accuracy = 97.73 %
	   Testing Accuracy =  99 %

  Salinas_A :-->
	a)epoches = 30
	  Training Accuracy = 98.86 %
	  Testing Accuracy = 100 %

4. From result HybridSN works way better than other 2D or 3D CNN model.
